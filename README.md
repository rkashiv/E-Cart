## How It Works

### Functional Flow
1. **Product Listing:**  
   All products are fetched or stored locally and displayed dynamically using the `map()` function.

2. **Add to Cart:**  
   When the user clicks **Add to Cart**, the selected product is stored in the cart state (using `useState` or `Context API`).

3. **Cart Management:**  
   The cart displays all added products, their quantities, and total price.  
   Users can remove items or update quantity.

4. **Routing:**  
   `React Router` is used to navigate between **Home**, **Products**, and **Cart** pages without reloading.
